Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a simple method for finding a target element within a list. It works by iterating through each element in the list until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached. Here's a description of the linear search algorithm:

1. **Start at the Beginning:**
   The search begins from the first element in the list.

2. **Comparison:**
   Compare the target element with the current element being examined.

3. **Search Iteration:**
   Repeat the comparison for each element in the list, moving sequentially from one element to the next.

4. **Element Found:**
   If the target element is found during this process, the search stops, and the index or position of the element is returned.

5. **Element Not Found:**
   If the end of the list is reached without finding the target element, the search concludes, and a special value (such as -1) is often returned to indicate that the element is not present in the list.

Here's a simple implementation of linear search in Python:

```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i  # Element found, return its index
    return -1  # Element not found

# Example usage:
my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
target_element = 6

result = linear_search(my_list, target_element)

if result != -1:
    print(f"Element {target_element} found at index {result}.")
else:
    print(f"Element {target_element} not found in the list.")
```

It's important to note that linear search has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This means the time taken for the search is directly proportional to the size of the list. For larger datasets, more efficient search algorithms like binary search may be preferred.
